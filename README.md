# fs2-playground

A playground for `FS2`(aka Functional Streams for Scala). Currently, we are using M3 artefacts in this playground. 

If you are new to FS2, I would suggest taking a look at: 

1. [the Official Guide]: (https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2/blob/series/0.9/docs/guide.md)
2. [video series on FS2 by @mpilquist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFrwDVdSrYE6PVD_p6YQLAbNaEHagx9bW)


A bit of a shameless plug: I have recently presented FS2 at [@amsscala meetup](http://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-scala/events/231442786/). Slides are available at : http://www.slideshare.net/mdadilakhter/fs2-for-fun-and-profit.
